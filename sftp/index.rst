SFTP Access

Users who need to upload substantial amounts of data may request `SFTP
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SSH_File_Transfer_Protocol>`__ access to
upload their data files more efficiently than is possible over HTTP.

SFTP access is granted on a case-by-case basis. Please contact `technical
support <mailto:support@dydra.com>`__ to request SFTP credentials.
