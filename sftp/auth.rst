SFTP Authentication
===================

SFTP access requires a distinct, unique password which will be issued to you
when SFTP access is granted for and enabled on your user account.

.. note::

   It is not possible for a user to directly change the SFTP password; in
   case the password should become compromised due to accidental disclosure
   from the user to third parties, please contact `technical support
   <mailto:support@dydra.com>`__ soonest to request a password reset.
